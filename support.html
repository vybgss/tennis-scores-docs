    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>1. How do I start tracking a match?</strong><br />
        Simply enter the players’ names and tap "Start Match." Once the match is started, you can record points as they happen.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>2. How do I add a point to a player?</strong><br />
        During an active match, tap the "Point to [Player]" button for the player who won the point. The score updates automatically.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>3. Can I track sets and tiebreaks?</strong><br />
        Yes. The app automatically handles scoring progression through games, sets, and tiebreaks. When a set reaches 6–6, a tiebreak is initiated and scoring adjusts accordingly.

        <strong>4. What if I need to reset or end the match early?</strong><br />
        Tap "End Match" to confirm ending the current match. You can start a new one afterwards. If you need to completely reset, use the "Reset" option.
      </li>

        <strong>5. Can I change player names mid-match?</strong><br />
        Player names should be set before starting the match. To change them, end or reset the current match, update the names, then start a new match.
